 ******************************
 *
 * This view is required to be displayed where users enter their credit/debit card details.
 * It presents a description and checkbox that, when checked, stores the card info for
 * purchases in other apps.
 *
 * There is no VTCheckboxViewDelegate. This is just a view that you should add to your payment
 * entry form. All delegate callbacks are handled through the delegate of your VTClient.
 *
 * Custom public methods on VTCheckboxView are just for styling.
 *
 * You must use [client checkboxView] to alloc and init a VTCheckboxView.
 * Do NOT create a VTCheckboxView with [[VTCheckboxView alloc] init]
 *
 * The default size of a VTCheckboxView is 300 width x 50 height (English language). Based on
 * the language however, it can be 66 or 82 pixels in height. It is best to use the height of the
 * checkbox dynamically, using `checkboView.frame.size.height`, after it is created. The height can
 * not be changed, but the width can be set to any value greater than or equal to 280.

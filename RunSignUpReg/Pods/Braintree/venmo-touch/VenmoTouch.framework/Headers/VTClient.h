 * Venmo SDK - Version 2.0.3

 ******************************
 ******************************
 * VTClient.h
 ******************************
 ******************************
 *
 * The VTClient manages all view creation and delegate methods so that your users can more
 * quickly and securely make payments. If a payment method was previously entered in another
 * app on the Braintree network, you can prompt the user to use that card without her having
 * to retype the payment method credentials (i.e. credit card number).
 *
 * Please create a single instance of a VTClient within your app to manage all payment method
 * interactions. Once a client has been created using one of the custom "initWithMechantID..."
 * methods (shown below), you may use "[VTClient sharedClient]" to return a singleton of the
 * client object.
 *
 * The Braintree sandbox gateway environment allows for testing without using real payment details.
 * To test Venmo Touch in your sandbox environment, init your VTClient and pass in
 * VTEnvironmentSandbox as your testing environment.
 *
 * To init a VTClient, you will have to pass in your Braintree credentials: your merchantID and
 * client-side encryption key.
 *  1. Sandbox credentials can be found here: https://sandbox.braintreegateway.com/login
 *  2. Production credentials are found here: https://www.braintreegateway.com/login
 *
 * While testing in the sandbox environment, please use your sandbox
 * credentials. Similarly, create your VTClient and pass in VTEnvironmentSandbox as your
 * testing environment.
 *
 * When you're ready to move to production, init your
 *
 * When users manually enter a new payment method, please create and add a VTCheckboxView
 * near the form.
 *
 * If there is at least 1 payment method on file for that user, you will be able to create a
 * VTCardView and display that to the user. The VTCardView will present the user with a
 * payment method that was entered in a previous app on this phone. The user will then have the
 * option to select that payment method for use in your app or continue with the default
 * flow to add a new payment method. We recommend adding the VTCardView directly above the
 * manual credit card entry form for optimal conversion.
 *
 * The Venmo SDK does not support iOS versions below 5.0. For iOS devices running iOS below 5.0,
 * initializing a VTClient object will return nil. Similarly, initializing touch views on devices
 * below iOS 5.0 will return nil.
 *
 ******************************
 * Adding a card to Braintree
 ******************************
 *
 * After a user manually enters card information to your app, it is the app's job to encrypt the card (described below)
 * information and send it to the merchant's servers. Then, the merchant server will send the
 * encrypted card information to Braintree for a payment token. There is one additional parameter
 * that is required to send to the Braintree servers, the parameter is called "venmo_sdk_session".
 * It is the app's job to get the "venmo_sdk_session" parameter and send it to the the merchant
 * servers alongside the encrypted credit card data.
 *
 * The app can get the "venmo_sdk_session" string in two different ways:
 *
 * 1. "[client venmoSDKSession]" returns an encrypted string. It is your job to encrypt the
 *    card data using the BraintreeEncryption library and then include the "venmo_sdk_session" as
 *    an additional parameter.
 *
 * 2. "[client encryptedCardDataAndVenmoSDKSessionWithCardDictionary:cardInformationDictionary]"
 *    will accept a read-only NSDictionary of your unencrypted card values and encrypt them using 
 *    your Braintree key. Then, it will add the "venmo_sdk_session" data as an additional item
 *    in the parameters. Finally, it will return a new NSDictionary with the encrypted card
 *    data and the additional "venmo_sdk_session" parameter.

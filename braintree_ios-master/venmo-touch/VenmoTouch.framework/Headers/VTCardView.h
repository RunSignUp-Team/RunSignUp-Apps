 *
 * This view allows you to suggest existing payment methods to your users, so they don't have to
 * type in their card details. You can style it and set its origin & bounds by using the public
 * methods provided below.
 *
 * There is no VTCardViewDelegate. This is just a view that you should add to your payment
 * entry form. All delegate callbacks are handled through the delegate of your VTClient.
 *
 * Custom public methods on VTCardView are just for styling.
 *
 * You must use [client cardView] to alloc and init a VTCardView.
 * Do NOT create a VTCardView with [[VTCardView alloc] init]
 *
 * The default size of a VTCardView is 300 width x 74 height. The height can not be changed,
 * but the width can be set to any value greater than or equal to 280.
